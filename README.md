⚠️ 🚧 **WARNING:** 💩 code ahead 🚧 ⚠️

**Help wanted.** I am a Swift noob. I don’t know how to turn this code into binary... I click run on Xcode and it kinda works, but if I run the binary from the terminal, it crashes. Some help would be appreciated.

## How to use

Open the Xcode project and click **Run.**
